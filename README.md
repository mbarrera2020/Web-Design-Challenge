Description:  Using HTML and CSS to create a dashboard to show weather analysis / visualization.

### Latitude Analysis Dashboard 

This is a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created in a past assignment -- weather plotting. 

Data file:  weather data --> Resources/cities.csv

In building this dashboard, individual pages will be created for each plot and a means to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is a landing page, a page showing a comparison of all of the plots and another page to view the data used to build them.

The website has 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page] containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

* Four [visualization pages] each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

* A ["Comparisons" page] that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

* A ["Data" page] that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    * The table has a bootstrap table component.
    * The data comes from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.

The website has a navigation menu.
